YIELD: 4-5	UNITS: US
INGREDIENTS Nutrition
1 (12 1/3 ounce) package silken tofu (Mori-Nu Firm or Extra-Firm)
3/4 cup almond milk
1 cup chocolate chips
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
DIRECTIONS
Place almond milk and chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl and heat about 1 minute depending on your microwave. Stir together until chocolate chips are dissolving in milk, you should now have a rich chocolate milk. If necessary, heat a bit a longer. Let the mixutre cool for a few minutes.
Add chocolate mixture, tofu, and vanilla to a food processor or blender and process until pureed. This is important: taste the mixture to make sure you don't a have a tofu taste since all brands are different. If it's not chocolaty enough you can melt some more chocolate chips and add it but don't add any more milk or it won't set properly.
Pour into 4-5 ramekins or small dishes. It will set better this way than if it's in one big bowl. Chill 2-3 hours and it's ready to eat!
